Hey, I'm AJ ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lifelong nerd who has always been into play with imagination. 

I discovered the fun of tabletop RPG's a few years ago, when my friends invited me to a game of [*Call of Cthulhu*](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/). I was instantly hooked. There was something truly amazing about a game where the only limitation is what you can picture in your minds eye.

I began to explore other RPG systems, and quickly picked up the 5e *Player's Handbook*.
