Hey, I'm AJ ðŸ‘‹

![self portrait of AJ](/images/self-portrait.jpeg)

I'm a lifelong nerd who has always been into play with imagination. 

I discovered the fun of tabletop RPG's a few years ago, when my friends invited me to a game of [*Call of Cthulhu*](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/). I was instantly hooked. There was something truly amazing about a game where the only limitation is what you can picture in your minds eye.

I began to explore other RPG systems, and quickly picked up the 5e D&D [*Player's Handbook*](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook) and was immediately sucked into the world of the Forgotten Realms.

I got to build my first character - ***Bloodmaw***, the red Dragonborn Barbarian - and play in a short campaign with my TTRPG group. I loved how D&D made character creation so much fun, and how it balanced combat, puzzles, and roleplaying.

Soon, I had to get a peek behind the screen. I picked up the starter box set and read [*The Lost Mine of Phandelver*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop). Seeing how adventures were structured, and how the DM was able to bend and twist the narrative as the players approached challenges, surprised and excited me. I was determined to run a game myself.

I ~~tricked~~ convinced my wife and her family to play with me during our Christmas holiday, and had an absolute blast. I was amazed to see the players approach obstacles in completely unexpected in hilarious ways, and the way it forced me to improvise and imagine new scenarios was so engaging.

Newly emboldened, I immediately brought the game to my friends and ran the same adventure for them. We literally laughed for hours straight as they bumbled through the intro adventure, making choices that completely diverged from anything that happened in my family game. 

I soon realized one of the joys of being a DM - just experiencing the unexpected turns every group makes, and how they are *never* the same. Ever since, I've loved setting up new challenges and storylines for my friends to play through, overcome, and twist in their unique ways.

In the last few years, I've had the joy to play in, and DM for, multiple amazing campaigns. I played my Goliath Fighter ***Gwinn "Dawnclimber" Ropajidako*** to level 7, and am currently in a multi-year campaign with my Firbolg Circle-of-Stars Druid ***Horben***.

I've also been DM'ing two separate iterations of [*Waterdeep: Dragon Heist*](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dragonheist), which has been my most challenging and exciting campaign so far to run.

I hope to continue building my experience with D&D and TTRPG's in general, and this site is a way to share that experience and push myself to learn new things. While I've learned a *ton*, and can recognize the skills I've gained as a DM and player so far - I know I'm just beginning my gaming journey.

Thanks for reading! Let's roll.
