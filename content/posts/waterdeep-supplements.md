[***Waterdeep: Dragon Heist***](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dragonheist) is one of the most exciting adventure modules for D&D 5e, dropping your Level 1 adventuring party into the heart of the *'City of Splendors'*. But how can you take this dense urban caper and make it your own?

Waterdeep is one of the most well known cities in the Forgotten Realms, positively brimming with adventure and backed up with heaps and heaps of lore. In the book there is an entire appendix - *"Voloâ€™s Waterdeep Enchiridion"* - which introduces the DM and adventurers to the city in a crash course that covers history, locations and getting around, and special events & points of interest.

All of this is extremely helpful to those new to Waterdeep, while simultaneously being *completely overwhelming*. Not only do you have to try to internalize some of this lore to have it ready at the table when you offer the occasional History check, but you probably also want to try to populate Waterdeep in a way that makes it feel as big as it's described when your players are moving around the world.

Here are my tips for running ***Waterdeep: Dragon Heist***, along with the most useful sources & supplements I've gone to along the way.

## Buy the Right Sources

Before you can get started running your game, you need to acquire the right materials. But before you start shelling out that cold hard cash, you need to consider the game you plan to run.

**If you're running the game in-person**, then the [adventure book](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dragonheist) is indispensible. Having that reference on-hand during the game is super useful. In my experience quickly flipping through the pages of the adventure book is much more effective even than swapping tabs and searching the text of a digital book.

**If you're running the game remotely**, then the physical book is a luxury, not a necessity. Instead, you need to decide on one or more digital versions of the module. Your two options are:

- Buy the adventure on [Roll20](https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/3825/waterdeep-dragon-heist) or your favorite VTT (Virtual Tabletop) of choice.
- Purchase the adventure source on [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh).

#### Roll20 (or VTT)

In general, I would strongly suggest buying the VTT version of the adventure. On Roll20, purchasing the adventure gives you access to the entire text of the adventure *plus*:

- All of the maps included in the adventure, pre-built with the proper size, layers, and dynamic lighting.
- All of the key NPC's, monsters, and other tokens populated in the VTT with character sheets & abilities.
- The adventure structure broken out by season, so you get only the versions of the map you need, pre-populated with the correct monster tokens & lighting.

These features add up to hours of prep time saved, meaning you have much more time to focus on the story you want to tell, or by enhancing your Roll20 game with additional maps & characters.

#### D&D Beyond

So if you've already decided to pick up the Roll20 Marketplace version for your remote game, or the physical book for your in-person game - then why would you turn to D&D Beyond?

The primary reason the D&D Beyond sources are valuable, is it opens up the possibility of sharing some content with your campaign. This is especially useful during character creation.
